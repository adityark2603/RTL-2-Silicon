## üóûÔ∏è Good floorplan vs Bad floorplan and Introduction to library cells

### üçÅ <ins>Chip Floor Planning Considerations:</ins>
####  <ins>Core and Die Concept:</ins> 
The **core** is the area in a chip used to place all the **logic cells and components**. It is the region where the actual **logic implementation** of the chip resides.
The **die** is the area that **encircles the core area** and is used for placing **I/O-related components**.

#### <ins>Core and Die Dimensions:</ins>  
The **height** and **width** of the **core area** are determined by the **netlist of the design**. It will be based on the number of components required in order to execute the logic, and the height and width of the die area will be dependent on the core area height and width.
The **die area** dimensions depend on the **core area** dimensions.


For example, consider a **netlist** that has 2 logic gates and 2 flip-flops: <br>

Each component has an area of **1 sq. unit**.  
Thus, the **minimum total area required** for the **core** = `4 sq. units`.

#### <ins>Utilization Factor: </ins>
The ratio of the core area occupied by the netlist to the total core area.

$$\[
\text{Utilization Factor} = \frac{\text{Area occupied by netlist}}{\text{Total core area}}
\]$$

‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>**Note:**</ins>  For a good floorplan, the **Utilization Factor should never be 1**, because a uUtilization Factor of 1 means **no extra space** is available for routing or adding additional logic. Such a design is considered a **bad floorplan**.

#### <ins>Aspect Ratio:</ins>
The ratio of the height of the core to the width of the core.

$$\[
\text{Aspect Ratio} = \frac{\text{Height of the core}}{\text{Width of the core}}
\]$$

  - If **Aspect Ratio = 1**, the core is **square-shaped**.  
  - If **Aspect Ratio ‚â† 1**, the core is **rectangular**.


**For example:** <br>
<ins>**Case 1**</ins>:
Core area = 4 sq. units (2 √ó 2)

$$\[
\text{Utilization Factor} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]  
\[
\text{Aspect Ratio} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
\]$$

‚à¥ The core is **square-shaped**.

<ins>**Case 2**</ins>:
Core area = 8 sq. units (2 √ó 4)

$$\[
\text{Utilization Factor} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5
\]  
\[
\text{Aspect Ratio} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]$$

‚à¥ The core is **rectangular-shaped**.

#### <ins>Preplaced cells:</ins>
Preplaced cells are fixed standard cells or macros whose locations are defined before the automated placement stage in VLSI physical design. These cells are ‚Äúpre-placed‚Äù at specific coordinates and are not moved during the regular placement optimization process.

#### <ins>Decoupling Capacitors:</ins> 
Decoupling capacitors (or decaps) are capacitors placed between the power (VDD) and ground (VSS) lines in an integrated circuit to stabilize the supply voltage and reduce noise. They act as local energy reservoirs that supply instant current to nearby logic cells when there are sudden changes in current demand, preventing voltage drops and fluctuations.

#### <ins>Power Planning: </ins>
Power planning is the process of designing the power and ground distribution network in an IC to ensure that every cell receives a stable voltage. It involves creating power rings, straps, and grids to minimize IR drop and maintain uniform power delivery.

#### <ins>Problem with having a single power supply:</ins>
A single power supply can cause uneven voltage distribution, leading to IR drops, noise coupling, and poor performance, especially in large chips with high current demands.

**Problem 1:** Ground bounce occurs when a sudden switching current through the package inductance causes a temporary rise in ground potential, leading to noise and logic errors. It‚Äôs common in high-speed circuits with many simultaneous switching outputs.

**Problem 2:** Voltage droop is the temporary reduction in supply voltage due to high current demand and resistance in power lines. It can slow down or even malfunction logic circuits if the voltage drops below threshold levels.

**Advantage of Distributed Power Supply:**
A distributed power supply network provides uniform voltage, reduces IR drop and noise, and improves reliability by delivering power locally to each region of the chip through multiple well-planned routes.

#### <ins>Pin Placement:</ins>
Pin placement refers to the process of assigning and fixing the input/output (I/O) pins of a design on the periphery of the chip or block. Proper pin placement ensures efficient routing, minimizes signal delay, and reduces congestion. It plays a crucial role in achieving timing closure and optimizing power and performance.

#### <ins>Logical Cell Placement Blockage: </ins>
A logical cell placement blockage is a restricted region defined in the floorplan where no standard cells (logic cells) can be placed.

### üìå <ins>Library Binding & Placement:</ins>
#### <ins>Netlist Binding & Initial Place Design:</ins>
Netlist binding and initial place design involve mapping the logical netlist to its corresponding physical library cells (binding), ensuring that each gate or component is associated with a real, manufacturable cell. Once bound, the placement stage arranges these cells within the chip‚Äôs floorplan to optimize area, timing, and interconnect length before detailed routing.

#### <ins>Optimize Placement using Estimated Wire-Length & Capacitance: </ins>
Involves refining the initial cell positions by estimating interconnect wire lengths and capacitive loads. These estimates guide the placement tool to minimize delay, power consumption, and congestion, ensuring better overall timing and signal integrity before routing.

#### <ins>Library Characterization & Modelling:</ins>
Library characterization and modelling is the process of simulating and analyzing standard cells to extract and model critical electrical parameters such as timing, power, and noise under various operating conditions.
