#### <ins>SPICE Deck:</ins>
A SPICE deck is the set of input files (or commands) that you provide to a SPICE simulator to describe and analyze an electronic circuit.
At its core, a SPICE deck is a plain text file that contains:
  - A description of the circuit components and how they are connected.
  - Commands telling SPICE what kind of analysis to perform (e.g., DC, AC, transient).
  - Commands to output the results (e.g., .PRINT, .PLOT). <br>

#### <ins>Switching Threshold:</ins>
The input voltage where $$V_{in} = V_{out}$$, representing the trip point where the output flips state.
  - Also known as the **trip point** or **metastable point**
  - For CMOS inverters: Typically designed to be $$V_{dd}/2$$ for symmetric switching
  - Represents the boundary between logical '0' and '1' states
