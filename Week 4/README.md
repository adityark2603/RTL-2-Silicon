## Day 1 ‚Äì Basics of NMOS Drain Current (Id) vs Drain-to-Source Voltage (Vds)
Studied the I‚ÄìV characteristics of an NMOS transistor and understood how drain current varies with Vds in different regions of operation (cutoff, linear, and saturation). Analyzed the impact of gate voltage on channel formation and current conduction.

## Day 2 ‚Äì Velocity Saturation and Basics of CMOS Inverter VTC
Explored the concept of carrier velocity saturation in short-channel devices and its effect on current behavior. Learned to plot and interpret the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) of a CMOS inverter to understand its switching properties.

## Day 3 ‚Äì CMOS Switching Threshold & Dynamic Simulations
Determined the switching threshold voltage (V<sub>M</sub>) of a CMOS inverter and performed transient simulations to observe rise/fall times and propagation delays. Understood how transistor sizing affects switching dynamics.

## Day 4 ‚Äì CMOS Noise Margin Robustness Evaluation
Analyzed the noise margins (NM<sub>H</sub> and NM<sub>L</sub>) of a CMOS inverter from its VTC curve to assess logic robustness. Learned how process and voltage variations can influence noise immunity and reliability.

## Day 5 ‚Äì CMOS Power Supply and Device Variation Robustness Evaluation
Investigated the effects of power supply fluctuations (V<sub>DD</sub> variation) and device parameter variations on CMOS inverter performance. Evaluated circuit stability and robustness under real-world manufacturing and operating conditions.
