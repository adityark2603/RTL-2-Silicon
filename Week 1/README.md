# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD
## Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis
Learned the fundamentals of Verilog HDL, focusing on RTL (Register Transfer Level) design principles and how synthesis converts high-level Verilog code into gate-level hardware. Understood the design flow from RTL coding to netlist generation.

## Day 2 -  Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding
Explored the role of timing libraries (.lib files) in defining cell delays and constraints. Studied various synthesis approaches and best practices for writing efficient, timing-aware flip-flop code to achieve optimal performance.



## Day 3 - Combinational & Sequential Optimizations
Analyzed techniques for optimizing combinational and sequential logic during synthesis. Learned how synthesis tools minimize area, delay, and power while preserving functionality through logic restructuring and resource sharing.

## Day 4 - Gate Level Simulation(GLS), Blocking vs Non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch
Performed Gate Level Simulation to verify post-synthesis behavior and timing. Understood the difference between blocking and non-blocking assignments in Verilog and identified causes of synthesis-simulation mismatches.

## Day 5 - Optimization in synthesis
Focused on advanced synthesis optimization techniques to improve circuit speed, area, and power. Learned how to fine-tune design constraints and use synthesis reports to iteratively refine RTL for better results.
