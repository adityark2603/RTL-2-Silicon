## Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis ‚úèÔ∏è
### Simulator:
RTL Design is checked for adherence to the specifications by simulating the design.  
**Example:** `iverilog` <br>

### Design:
Actual Verilog code that has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications. 

### Testbench:
Set up to apply stimulus (test vectors) to the design to check its functionality. <br>

### Working of a Simulator:
1. The simulator looks for the changes in the input signals.  
2. Upon a change to the input, the output is evaluated.  
3. The simulator is looking for a change in the values of the input.

### Synthesizer:
A tool used to convert RTL to a netlist.  
**Example:** `Yosys`

### Logic Synthesis:
- **RTL Design** ‚Üí Behavioural representation of the required specification.  
- **Synthesis** ‚Üí RTL to Gate level translation.  
  The design is converted into gates and the connections are made between gates.  
  This is given out as a file called **`netlist`**.

### What is `.lib`?
- Collection of logical modules.  
- Includes basic logic gates like **AND, OR, NOT, etc.**  
- Contains different flavours of the same gate: **Slow, Fast, Medium**  

---

### Why are different flavours of gates needed?
The **combinational delay** in the logic path determines the maximum speed of operation of a digital logic circuit.  

$$
T_{CLK} \>\ T_{CQ_A} \+\ T_{COMBINATIONAL} \+\ T_{SETUP}
$$

$$
f_{clk_{MAX}} \=\ \frac{1}{T_{clk_{MIN}}}
$$


- We need **fast cells** to make `T_COMBINATIONAL` small and meet required performance.  
- We need **slow cells** to ensure there are no **HOLD issues** at `DFF_B`.  

‚ö° **Cell Selection is Important!**  
- Overuse of faster cells ‚Üí Bad circuit in terms of **power & area**, plus **hold time violations**.  
- Overuse of slower cells ‚Üí **Sluggish circuit**, may fail to meet performance requirements.

## Faster Cells vs Slower Cells

In digital logic circuits, the **load** is represented by **capacitance**.  
The charging/discharging speed of this capacitance determines the **cell delay**.

- Faster charging/discharging ‚Üí Lesser delay  
- Slower charging/discharging ‚Üí More delay  

To achieve faster charging/discharging, transistors must be able to source more current.  
This introduces a trade-off between **speed, area, and power**.
