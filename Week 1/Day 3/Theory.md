## 🔭 Combinational & Sequential Optimizations  
### 💡 <ins>Logic Circuits</ins>  
### Combinational Circuits  
- Time-independent circuits — outputs depend **only on current inputs**.  
- No memory — do not depend on previous input values.  

### Sequential Circuits  
- Time-dependent — outputs depend on **both present and past inputs**.  
- Require **clock cycles** since they have memory elements.  



## 🧠 Introduction to Logic Optimizations  
Logic optimization is crucial to:  
-  Reduce total logic area  
-  Lower power consumption  
-  Improve overall circuit performance
