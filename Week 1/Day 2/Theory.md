### üèÜ NAND vs NOR Implementation

| Aspect              | NAND Gate                          | NOR Gate                          | Advantage                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Transistor Efficiency | PDN (NMOS) in series, PUN (PMOS) in parallel | PDN (NMOS) in parallel, PUN (PMOS) in series | NAND - Faster, smaller, better PMOS arrangement |
| Speed               | Shorter propagation delay          | Delay worsens with fan-in (series PMOS) | NAND - Better scalability          |
| Power Consumption   | Lower static & dynamic power       | Higher capacitance from series PMOS | NAND - More power-efficient        |
| Universality        | Universal gate                     | Universal gate                    | Equal                              |
| Practical Usage     | Preferred in fabrication           | Less preferred                    | NAND - Better CMOS performance     |
| Memory Applications | NAND Flash: High density, low cost | NOR Flash: Faster random access   | NAND - Dominates for storage       |


***Abbreviations:** PDN = Pull-Down Network, PUN = Pull-Up Network*

###  ‚ùìWhy is Submodule Synthesis Needed?

- Breaks large designs into manageable blocks
- Reduces tool runtime and complexity
- Pre-optimized modules (ALU, FIFO, decoder) can be reused across projects
- Easier to test and pinpoint issues in smaller blocks
</br>

### ‚ùìWhy are Flip-Flops Essential?
- They provide memory capability, allowing circuits to remember past states for sequential logic operations.
- They synchronize all circuit operations to clock edges, preventing timing errors and race conditions.
- They enable pipelining and glitch filtering by breaking long combinational paths and ensuring stable data sampling.
</br>

### ‚ùìWhat is a Glitch?
- Unwanted short pulse caused by different path delays in combinational logic
- **Danger:** Can trigger unintended events in combinational systems
- **Solution:** Flip-flops filter glitches by sampling only at clock edges

## ‚åõ Flip-Flop Timing Parameters 



| Parameter | Description | Importance |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Setup Time (Tsetup)** | Input must be stable before clock edge | Prevents metastability |
| **Hold Time (Thold)** | Input must remain stable after clock edge | Ensures proper capture |
| **Clock-to-Q Delay (Tcq)** | Output delay after clock edge | Defines propagation timing |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Violations cause metastability (unpredictable output)**

### **üìù <ins> D Flip-Flop Applications</ins>**: 
#### 1. In Combinational Circuits
- Output synchronization to a clock edge
- Glitch filtering at the final output stage
- Pipeline stage insertion for timing optimization

#### 2. In Sequential circuits
- State storage for finite state machines
- Data storage in registers and memory elements
- Synchronization element in counters and shift registers


### **üìù<ins> D Flip-Flop Types</ins>**: 
#### 1. Synchronous (Syn) DFF
- Definition: Input changes affect output only at clock edges
- Usage: Registers, pipelines, counters, state machines
- Timing: Tsetup, Thold, Tcq
- Advantages: Predictable, easy to analyze, eliminates race conditions

#### 2. Asynchronous (Async) DFF  
- Definition: Output changes via external signals (reset/preset), ignoring clock
- Usage: Counter reset, register initialization, interrupt handling
- Characteristics: Immediate response, potential timing hazards
- Advantages: Fast control response
- Disadvantages: Metastability risk, harder timing control
