Welcome to my journey through the RISC-V SoC Tapeout program VSD!!! ü•∞ü•∞
<br>

*In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V Chip Tapeout initiative, empowering more than 3500 participants to build silicon & advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.*

## ‚åõ Week 0 - Initial Setup & Tools Installation

### Key Learnings from Week 0:
  1. Successfully installed & verified **open-source EDA tools** ecosystem
  2. Learnt about **basic environment setup** for RTL design & synthesis
  3. Prepared for upcoming **RTL ‚û°Ô∏è GSIII** flow projects
<br>

## üìå Week 1 - Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis
<br>



## üôè Acknowledgment 
I am grateful to [**Kunal Ghosh**](https://github.com/kunalg123) and Team **[VLSI System Design (VSD)](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/)** for the opportunity to participate in the ongoing **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.
