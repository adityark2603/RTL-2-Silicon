Welcome to my journey through the RISC-V SoC Tapeout program VSD!!! ü•∞ü•∞
<br>

*In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V Chip Tapeout initiative, empowering more than 3500 participants to build silicon & advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.*
